Robotics Simulations Using PyBullet

A robotics simulation project in PyBullet (Google Colab) featuring a two-wheeled robot and static obstacles modeled with URDFs. The robot is placed in three different positions within a scene, which is captured from three camera viewpoints. Results are displayed in a 3×3 grid.

Features
* Two-wheeled robot (URDF).
* Static obstacles: wall, pillar, table, boxes.
* PyBullet simulation in DIRECT mode.
* Multi-view rendering with Matplotlib (3 robot poses × 3 cameras).
